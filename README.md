* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html)
* [Less Stylesheets](http://lesscss.org/) + [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)
* User management, including code for:
    * Twitter authentication
    * Facebook authentication

    * Others (untested)
* Simple API & RESTful API code, including
	* Auto-generate HTML forms from GAE models
	* AJAX updates to GAE models
